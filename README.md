# Orders Processor
This Processor reads Item and Order data from files, processes orders by adding items and calculating totals, and generates detailed summaries and reports. 
# Instructions

1. To install the processor, clone the repository and upload it to an IDE like Ecplise. If you are using Eclipse, select File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace > Select root directory. Then browse to the cloned repository and upload. In the IDE run the "OrdersProcessor.java" class.
2. To ensure that you can use this processor for your orders, make sure that each Order is in its own individual text file, and that each order has the same base name, with the only difference being the number at the end of the base name starting at 1 up to the number of orders wanted to be processed. You also want to make sure that you have a list of the inventory in its own text file. Each line of the inventory should have the item and its price sepreated by one space, one on each line. <br>

3. Interact with the Console and answer the prompted questions such as the name of the inventory file in the image above, whether you want the process done with singular or multithreading, the base file name for orders, number of orders, and also the name of the text file you want the summary for each order and overall summary to be displayed.
4. Once you enter all that information, refresh the file you entered for where you wanted the results and they should be there.
